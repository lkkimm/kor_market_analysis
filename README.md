This trial project analyzes the South Korean market by filtering and recommending companies based on three criteria:
  (1) Price-to-Earnings Ratio (PER) between 5 and 10
  (2) Net worth around 1 trillion KRW
  (3) Positive growth trend over the past two months
This analysis is motivated by the recent pledge from South Koreaâ€™s newly elected president to raise the share prices of undervalued companies.
